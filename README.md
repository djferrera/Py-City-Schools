Columbia Data Analytics Boot Camp: Python Assignment


Summary
The PyCitySchools assignment looked at one district’s 15 high schools serving nearly 4,000 students. 
The provided data (gathered from standardized test results) has been gathered from both the seven district schools and eight charter schools. When reflecting on the data it is important to note that over two thirds of the students (69%) attend district schools, while a much smaller proportion (31%) attend charter schools.

District vs. Charter
The provided data is conclusive: charter schools perform better than district schools with an overall passing rate of 95% vs. 74%. Charter schools produce average math scores ~7% higher and average reading scores ~3% higher than district schools.
The top five performing schools are all charter and the five worst performing schools are all district.

School Size
Based on the data, schools with a lower student count outperform schools with the highest student populations. As on average, charter schools have fewer students than district schools, their size is a factor in their success. 

Additional Thoughts
• I question the validity of the data. It is suspicious that all seven district schools produced identical (within tenths of a percent of one another) average math and average reading scores. Charter school results were only slightly more varied, differing by one percentage point.

• It has been a long held belief that an increase in school spending positively impacts students’ performances. The analysis of this data does not support that claim. On average district schools spend $44 more per student than charter schools, $643 compared to $599 and yet, across the board charter school students are the stronger performers.

• When comparing average math and reading scores by grade (9th - 12th), no significant changes were apparent, leading one to conclude that a student’s freshman year performance is predictive of their senior year performance.

• A more informative analysis would include metrics on student performances prior to entering high school. With the current data set, we are left to question if charter school students perform better OR if charter schools attract better performing students. Being able to also compare test scores from both elementary and middle school would help to enlighten us on this question.

• It is often debated if charter schools are a detriment to district schools. Even with this limited data, I would argue that more schools (of any kind) result in smaller class sizes, and smaller class sizes result in better student performance, hence more schools, charter or district, benefit every one.
